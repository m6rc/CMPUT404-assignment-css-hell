Gutenberg HTML mod
=================

On all the html files I commented out the style section and added a link to my stylesheet (stylesheet.css).

The main changes to the theme are changing the font families, sizes, margins/padding and background color. I also added an inset box shadow which gives it an old worn look. In order to change the background color of the black and white images I used the mix-blend-mode property, pretty neat. The changes are best shown in 1.html (pride and prejudice) because that book has a lot of images, and more complex html.
